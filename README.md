# Medicine-Reminder-Web-app
A simple and interactive voice-based medicine reminder application that helps users record, manage, and receive reminders for their medications using speech commands.
It’s fully offline-capable, uses local storage for data persistence, and includes voice-enabled reminders powered by the Web Speech API.

# How It Works

User adds medicine details (name, dosage, and time).

App saves the reminder data in local storage.

When the set time arrives:

A browser notification and voice reminder are triggered.

The voice reminder says something like:
“It’s time to take your Paracetamol — 1 tablet.”

Reminders stay saved even after refreshing or closing the browser.
